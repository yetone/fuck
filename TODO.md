# TODO

- Have character for marking end of line, and brackets around scopes/chunks/blocks
	- Note: methods and namespaces still needs type after closing bracket like ```} method```
- Variables inside scope, deleted when scope is finished (Garbage collector)
- No duplicate methods etc
- Clean up classes
- Fix less than or equal and more than or equal operators
- Fix breaking, skip close bracket
